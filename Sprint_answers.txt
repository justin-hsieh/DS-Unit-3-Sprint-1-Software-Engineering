I think getting a second set of eyes is important for code reviews because
it limits the potential for errors or directionally incorrect code. When I look
at code, I look to see if it makes sense and if there is a way to optimize it 
for readability and efficiency. Code reviews also help with uniformity of code
to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Containers help keep objects organized. They only allow specific access according 
to a set of rules and help optimize the life cycle of a project.
